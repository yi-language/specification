# _yi_ programming language
---
## basis
The _yi_ programming language is intended to be procedural low level and highly portable language.
Originally, the main idea to start this project was born in my mind during usual porting c code for my pet. This amount of work, needed to be done to make software capable to running on multiple operating systems is absurd. So i decided to write a small-footprint language interpreter to firstly test an idea of such language.

_(To explore language's syntax and features -> start with look into file **"cli.md"**)_

_Have a good day!_ ğŸ˜‰
